# Architecture

System design, component relationships, and the abstraction
boundaries that make the engine portable across 6502 platforms
while generating optimal code for each target.

## Layered Architecture

The engine is organized into four layers. Dependencies flow
downward only — no layer references anything above it.

### Layer Responsibilities

**Game Code** — written by the game author. Uses only the Engine
API. Never touches hardware registers directly. Compiled against
a specific platform configuration but contains no platform-
specific logic. A well-written game can be recompiled for a
different platform by changing only the platform type alias.

**Engine API** — the portable interface. Provides subsystems for
sprites, tiles, sound, input, timing, and static memory pools.
Parameterized by platform type. Uses `if constexpr` on capability
queries to select behavior. Contains no hardware addresses, no
register names, no platform-specific types.

**Capabilities** — compile-time declarations of what a platform
can and cannot do. Expressed as `static constexpr` members on
a capabilities struct. The Engine API queries these to make
decisions. Capabilities describe features (has_hardware_sprites,
sound_voices, has_blitter), not platform identity (is_atari,
is_c64).

**Platform HAL** — the hardware abstraction layer. One
implementation per platform family (Atari, C64, Apple II).
Provides concrete functions for register access, interrupt
installation, display construction, DMA configuration. The
Engine API calls the HAL through the platform type — static
dispatch via templates, never virtual functions.

### Why Capabilities Are Separate From the HAL

The HAL knows *how* to do things on specific hardware. The
Capabilities know *what* the hardware can do. The Engine API
only looks at Capabilities to decide *which* code path to take,
then calls the HAL to execute it.

This separation matters because:

- The Engine API never needs to include platform headers
- Adding a new platform means writing a HAL + a capability
  profile, not modifying the engine
- Capability queries are `constexpr` — the compiler eliminates
  dead paths entirely, so unused platform code generates zero
  bytes in the binary

## Platform Configuration

A platform is fully described by a type that composes a machine
identity with independent hardware extension axes:

```cpp
using MyPlatform = atari::Platform<
    atari::Machine::XL,
    atari::RAM::Rambo256,
    atari::Graphics::Baseline,
    atari::Sound::Stereo,
    atari::TV::NTSC,
    atari::Network::Fujinet     // optional, default: None
>;
```

This type carries the capability profile and the HAL
implementation. The engine is instantiated against it:

```cpp
using Game = engine::Core<MyPlatform, GameConfig>;
```

From this point forward, every engine subsystem knows exactly
what hardware is available, how much memory exists, how many
voices the sound system has, and whether a blitter is present.
All of this is resolved at compile time.

### Capability Profile Structure

Each platform type exposes a nested `capabilities` type with
`static constexpr` members. The engine queries these by name,
never by platform identity:

```cpp
// Engine code — platform-agnostic
template<typename Platform>
void render_sprites(...) {
    using caps = typename Platform::capabilities;

    if constexpr (caps::has_blitter) {
        Platform::hal::blit_sprite(...);
    } else if constexpr (caps::has_hardware_sprites) {
        Platform::hal::set_pm_graphics(...);
    } else {
        software_sprite_render(...);
    }
}
```

### Capability Categories

Capabilities are organized by subsystem:

**Graphics capabilities:**

- `has_hardware_sprites` — P/M graphics, VIC-II sprites, etc.
- `max_hardware_sprites` — count of hardware sprite objects
- `has_missiles` — separate missile objects (Atari-specific)
- `max_missiles` — count of missile objects
- `has_hardware_scroll` — hardware fine/coarse scroll support
- `has_blitter` — hardware blitter (VBXE)
- `has_display_list` — programmable display (ANTIC)
- `has_raster_interrupt` — mid-frame interrupt (DLI, raster IRQ)
- `sprite_width_options` — supported sprite widths
- `sprite_multiplexing` — whether engine should auto-multiplex

Bitmap mode support is intrinsic to ANTIC and does not require
a separate capability flag for Atari targets. When future
platforms are added, bitmap capabilities may be needed to
distinguish platforms with fundamentally different pixel modes.

**Sound capabilities:**

- `has_dedicated_sound` — dedicated sound chip present
- `sound_voices` — number of independent voices
- `has_stereo` — stereo output available
- `has_noise_generator` — hardware noise channel
- `has_filter` — hardware filter (SID, POKEY high-pass)
- `has_extended_sound` — PokeyMax or equivalent present
- `extended_sound_voices` — additional voice count

**Memory capabilities:**

- `main_ram_bytes` — conventional RAM available to game
- `has_extended_ram` — bank-switched memory present
- `extended_ram_bytes` — total extended RAM
- `extended_bank_size` — size of each switchable bank
- `zp_available` — zero page bytes available to engine + game

**Input capabilities:**

- `joystick_ports` — number of joystick inputs
- `has_keyboard` — keyboard input available
- `has_paddle` — analog paddle input

**Timing capabilities:**

- `cpu_frequency` — CPU clock in Hz
- `frames_per_second` — display refresh rate
- `cycles_per_frame` — total CPU cycles per frame
- `has_vbi` — vertical blank interrupt
- `has_raster_interrupt` — (shared with graphics)

**Network capabilities:**

- `has_network` — network hardware present
- `network_transport` — transport type (UDP, TCP, serial)
- `network_reliable` — whether transport guarantees delivery
- `network_max_payload` — maximum bytes per send
- `network_latency_ms` — approximate round-trip latency

## Engine Subsystems

The Engine API is composed of subsystems. Each subsystem is a
template parameterized by the platform type and optionally by
game configuration values. Subsystems are not independent
objects — they are facets of the single `engine::Core<Platform,
GameConfig>` instance, sharing the same platform type and
configuration.

### Subsystem Descriptions

**Static Pools** — `SlotPool<T,N>` and `PackedPool<T,N>`.
Fixed-size object pools with compile-time capacity. SlotPool
provides stable indices (required for sprite-to-hardware
mapping). PackedPool provides dense iteration (optimal for
iteration-only collections). No dynamic allocation. See
API_DESIGN.md for full specification.

**Game Loop** — owns the main loop and frame synchronization.
Waits for vertical blank, dispatches update and render phases,
manages frame timing. The game provides a callback via `run()`
(never returns) or `run_until()` (returns when callback signals
exit). The loop handles everything else.

**Screen Manager** — owns display list construction and screen
transitions. Uses two-phase display list construction (see
DECISIONS.md ADR-026): at compile time, builds a display list
template from the `DisplayLayout` (mode bytes, blank lines,
region structure) with placeholder LMS addresses and a table
of LMS byte positions; at `set_screen` time, copies the
template into RAM and patches LMS addresses to point into the
shared screen buffer at the correct offsets.

Each screen has its own display list in RAM (30-200 bytes
depending on complexity). All screens share a single screen
memory buffer sized to the largest screen's requirements. The
`set_screen<S>()` transition sequence:

1. Wait for VBI
2. Disable ANTIC DMA (screen goes blank)
3. Clear shared screen buffer
4. Copy display list template, patch LMS addresses
5. Set ANTIC DLISTL/H to the new display list
6. Update region view pointers
7. Clear non-persistent DLIs, rebuild DLI chain
8. Enable/disable P/M DMA per sprites_active
9. Set P/M resolution per pm_resolution (DMACTL bit)
10. Enable/disable scroll per scroll_active
11. Generate row address table if use_row_table
12. Re-enable ANTIC DMA
13. Call user transition callback
14. Resume frame loop

Region views are typed handles (`TextRegionView`,
`BitmapRegionView`) that store a pointer into the shared
buffer and expose only operations valid for their mode type.
Invalid operations (e.g., `plot()` on a text region) are
compile errors.

**Bitmap Drawing (gfx)** — provides pixel-level drawing
primitives for bitmap display regions. Available only on
`BitmapRegion` types. Core primitives: `plot`, `point`,
`clear`, `hline`, `blit`. Supports opt-in row address lookup
tables for fast pixel addressing. Additional primitives (line,
rect, masked blit) planned for future iterations.

**Interrupt Manager** — owns DLI chain construction and VBI
dispatch. Uses a two-tier DLI model (see DECISIONS.md ADR-019):
engine-internal DLIs (multiplex, scroll) are raw handlers with
minimal overhead (~20-30 cycles); user C++ DLIs go through a
dispatcher with automatic save/restore (~80 cycles overhead);
user raw DLIs bypass the dispatcher entirely. All DLI types
coexist in a single chain, sorted by scanline, with priority
ordering: engine multiplex first, engine scroll second, user
handlers third.

The chain is stored as a table of DLI slots (4 bytes each:
scanline, flags, handler pointer) with parallel handler and
next-pointer tables for fast indexed access during interrupts.
Static DLIs (registered at screen setup) and dynamic DLIs
(rebuilt per-frame by the multiplexer) share the single table.
The VBI merges and sorts them, sets DLI bits in the display
list, and points VDSLST at the first handler.

When `set_screen<S>()` is called, all non-persistent user DLIs
are cleared and the engine rebuilds the chain based on the new
screen's configuration. DLI priority order applies per-screen.

C++ DLI handlers must be non-capturing lambdas or plain
function pointers (see DECISIONS.md ADR-020). The dispatcher
uses a self-modifying JSR for indirect handler calls (see
DECISIONS.md ADR-021).

The interrupt manager requires 2 bytes of zero page (chain
index and scratch). MaxDLIs and MaxVBIHooks are template
parameters on the InterruptManager, not GameConfig fields.

**Input** — captures joystick and keyboard state once per frame
during VBI. Provides level (held) and edge (pressed/released)
detection. Debouncing handled internally. Game code receives
a snapshot, never polls hardware directly.

**Sprites** — manages logical sprites mapped to hardware P/M
resources. Each logical sprite has position (x, y), shape
pointer, height, and active flag (6 bytes per sprite). The
game writes logical sprite state during its render phase;
the engine commits to P/M hardware during VBI.

P/M memory management uses tracked-range clearing (see
DECISIONS.md ADR-022): only the scanline range that was
written last frame is cleared, saving ~3750 cycles versus
full clear. Min/max Y per player (8 bytes bookkeeping)
tracks the dirty range.

P/M resolution (single-line or double-line) is per-screen
(see ADR-023). Single-line: 1-scanline precision, 256 bytes
per player, 1792 bytes total. Double-line: 2-scanline steps,
128 bytes per player, 896 bytes total. The P/M memory block
is allocated at the maximum size needed by any screen.

**Multiplex** — a sub-component of Sprites, active when
logical sprite count exceeds 4 hardware players. Divides the
screen into vertical zones (default max 4 zones = 16 sprites).
Zone assignment algorithm:

1. Sort all active sprites by Y position using insertion sort
   every frame (see ADR-024 — nearly-sorted data makes this
   ~80-120 cycles for typical sprite counts)
2. Walk sorted list, greedily assign to zones: each zone holds
   up to 4 sprites, zone boundary placed at the midpoint
   between adjacent groups
3. Validate no sprite straddles a zone boundary (boundary must
   fall in a gap between sprites)
4. Build per-zone data: player assignments and HPOS values

Zone DLI handlers are engine-internal raw handlers (~53 cycles
each): save A, write HPOSP0-3 for the new zone, chain VDSLST,
restore A, RTI. These are registered as dynamic DLIs with the
interrupt manager and rebuilt every frame during VBI.

Collision reverse-mapping: GTIA collision registers accumulate
across the whole frame and don't distinguish zones. The
multiplex provides a candidates table — for each hardware
player, a bitmask of which logical sprites were assigned to it
across all zones. The game uses bounding-box overlap checks to
disambiguate. For non-multiplexed games (≤ 4 sprites), each
player maps to exactly one sprite with no ambiguity.

Missiles are not multiplexed in the initial implementation
(see ADR-025). The 4 hardware missiles are available directly.
ZoneInfo reserves space for future missile multiplexing.

**Tiles** — manages character-mode or map-mode backgrounds.
Owns tileset loading (into character set RAM), tilemap storage,
and viewport management. Works with Scroll for scrolling
backgrounds. Operations are scoped to TextRegion types in
mixed displays.

**Scroll** — manages hardware fine and coarse scrolling.
Coordinates with ANTIC display list modifications (coarse
scroll) and ANTIC scroll registers (fine scroll). Handles
the edge case of buffer wrapping and new-row/column loading.

**Sound** — manages POKEY voice allocation and sound effect /
music playback. Sound data is `constexpr` ROM tables.
Processing happens during VBI (envelope advancement, frequency
updates). Capability-gated for stereo POKEY and PokeyMax
extended voices.

**Network** — manages multiplayer connectivity via Fujinet or
equivalent hardware. Uses a state-sharing model: one machine
is the authoritative host running the full simulation, clients
send input and receive state snapshots. The game defines its
own state and input message structs; the engine handles
transport, framing, connection management, and polling.
Network I/O is polled once per frame during the main game
loop (not during VBI — SIO transactions are too long for
interrupt context). Capability-gated: games compiled without
a network axis have no `Game::net` and incur zero cost.
Implementation status: API designed, implementation deferred.

## Data Flow Per Frame

└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Key insight: the game's render phase writes to buffers during
the visible frame. The VBI commits those buffers to hardware.
This one-frame latency avoids tearing and racing with ANTIC
DMA. The game author does not need to think about this — the
API handles the buffering internally.

## User Extension Points

The engine is designed to be extended. User code can integrate
assembly language routines and take direct control of hardware
resources at well-defined seams.

### 1. DLI Handler Registration

The interrupt manager owns the DLI chain. Users can register
handlers in two ways:

**C++ handler (engine-managed):**

```cpp
Game::interrupts.add_dli(scanline, [](auto& ctx) {
    ctx.write_colpf0(0x2A);
});
```

The engine wraps the callback with register save/restore and
automatic chaining to the next DLI handler.

**Raw assembly handler (user-managed):**

```cpp
extern "C" void my_custom_dli();  // defined in .s file
Game::interrupts.add_raw_dli(scanline, my_custom_dli);
```

The user is responsible for:

- Saving and restoring A/X/Y registers
- Writing the next DLI vector address to VDSLST
- Staying within the cycle budget (typically 50-100 cycles)
- Executing RTI to return control to ANTIC

The engine documents the interrupt context in MEMORY_MAP.md,
including the DLI chain next-handler vector address and
available stack space.

### 2. VBI Hook Slots

After the engine completes its VBI work (input capture, sound
envelope processing, P/M register commits), it calls any
registered user VBI hooks:

```cpp
extern "C" void my_vbi_work();
Game::interrupts.add_vbi_hook(my_vbi_work);
```

The user hook runs in the deferred VBI (after OS processing).
Available cycle budget is documented and depends on the graphics
mode and engine housekeeping load.

The user hook must:

- Preserve A/X/Y (or use them temporarily and restore)
- Not install a new VBI vector (the engine owns the chain)
- Fit within the documented cycle budget

### 3. Zero Page Allocation

The game configuration reserves zero page bytes for user
assembly:

```cpp
struct GameConfig {
    static constexpr uint8_t user_zp_bytes = 8;
    // ...other config...
};
```

The engine's ZP allocator ensures:

- OS-reserved bytes are not touched
- Engine-reserved bytes are not touched
- User-reserved bytes are contiguous and documented
- Remaining ZP is free

The user can query the base address of their ZP region:

```cpp
constexpr uint8_t my_zp_base = Game::user_zp_base;
```

This symbol is available in both C++ and assembly. The user
can safely use `my_zp_base` through
`my_zp_base + user_zp_bytes - 1`.

### 4. Render Phase Hooks

The render phase has defined entry and exit points where user
code can inject work:

```cpp
// Before engine commits buffered sprite positions to P/M RAM
Game::hooks.pre_sprite_commit(my_sprite_modifier);

// After engine finishes all rendering, before frame ends
Game::hooks.post_render(my_custom_effect);
```

These hooks run in the main thread during the visible frame,
so they have access to the full frame cycle budget. They are
useful for effects that don't fit in a DLI or need to
coordinate with the game logic.

### 5. Resource Release and Reclamation

Rather than conflict with the engine over hardware resources,
the user can explicitly release a resource and take ownership:

```cpp
// Release sound channel 3 — engine stops managing it
Game::sound.release_channel(3);
// Now the user can write directly to POKEY channel 3 registers

// Release Player 2 — engine won't multiplex onto it
Game::sprites.release_player(2);
// Now the user can manage Player 2 directly

// Suspend scroll management for this frame
Game::scroll.suspend();
// User can write scroll registers directly

// Later, reclaim resources
Game::sound.reclaim_channel(3);
Game::sprites.reclaim_player(2);
Game::scroll.resume();
```

After release, the engine will not touch that resource. The
user owns it entirely. This is the cooperative pattern — the
engine and user code coexist by explicitly dividing ownership.

### 6. Direct Hardware Access

The engine does not lock out hardware registers. You can write
to COLPF0, AUDF1, or any other register at any time.

If you do, you accept these consequences:

- Writes to GTIA color registers will be overwritten by the
  next DLI or VBI that touches them, unless you've released
  that subsystem.
- Writes to POKEY audio registers will conflict with the sound
  subsystem. Call `Game::sound.release_channel(N)` first.
- Writes to ANTIC scroll registers will conflict with the scroll
  subsystem if active. Call `Game::scroll.suspend()` first.
- Writes to P/M position registers will be overwritten at next
  VBI commit, unless you've released that player.

The engine provides register addresses as constexpr values so
assembly code doesn't need to hardcode magic numbers:

```cpp
#include <engine/platform/atari/registers.h>
// atari::reg::COLPF0, atari::reg::AUDF1, etc.
```

## Why No Scanline-Sync Hook?

You might want to write: "run this code at scanline 100." The
naive implementation is polling VCOUNT in a loop:

```cpp
while (read_vcount() < 100);
do_effect();
```

This works but wastes cycles. On a 6502 running at 1.79 MHz,
waiting for a specific scanline can burn hundreds of cycles per
frame, killing your frame budget.

Instead, use one of these patterns:

**Pattern 1: DLI Handler (recommended)**

If your effect needs scanline precision, write a DLI handler.
If you're out of DLI slots, the multiplexer is consuming them,
which means you're already pushing the engine hard. Consider
whether the effect justifies the complexity.

```cpp
Game::interrupts.add_dli(100, [](auto& ctx) {
    ctx.write_colpf0(0x2A);  // effect
});
```

**Pattern 2: Main-Thread Effect (often better)**

If your effect doesn't need precise scanline placement, move it
into the game's update/render phase. Simpler, no cycle stress,
no interrupt context switching:

```cpp
void update(...) {
    // ...game logic...
    my_effect();  // runs in main thread
}
```

**Pattern 3: POKEY Timer (rare)**

If you truly need a timer interrupt separate from VBI/DLI, use
POKEY's timer and poll it in a VBI hook. This requires you to
manage POKEY timer state yourself.

The engine provides the tools for patterns 1 and 2, which cover
99% of real cases. Pattern 3 is available but requires manual
POKEY management.

## Dependency Rules

These rules are enforced by convention and verified by code
review. Breaking them means the architecture is degrading.

1. **Game code includes only `engine/*.h`** — never
   `engine/platform/*`. If game code needs a platform header,
   the engine API is missing an abstraction.

2. **Engine headers include `platform/*` only through the
   Platform template parameter** — never by name. No
   `#include "atari/hal.h"` in engine code. The platform
   type brings its own HAL.

3. **Capability queries use feature names, not platform
   identity** — `if constexpr (caps::has_blitter)`, never
   `if constexpr (is_atari_vbxe)`.

4. **No lateral dependencies between platform families** —
   `atari/` never references `c64/`. Shared concepts belong
   in `engine/` or `config/`.

5. **Subsystems depend downward only** — Sprites may use
   Pools and Interrupts. Sprites never reference Sound.
   The dependency order is:

   ```
   types / math (no dependencies)
     └─ pool (depends on types)
         └─ input, sound, network (depend on pool, types)
         └─ interrupt (depends on types)
             └─ screen (depends on interrupt, types)
                 └─ sprites, tiles, scroll, gfx (depend on
                    interrupt, screen, pool, types)
                     └─ core (depends on everything above)
                         └─ loop (depends on core)
   ```

6. **User assembly integrates through defined seams** —
   raw hardware access is permitted but documented as
   "you own the consequences." Cooperative resource release
   is the preferred pattern for coexistence.

7. **Platform HAL files depend only on hardware documentation**
   — they are thin wrappers over registers and DMA. They do
   not contain game logic or engine policy.

## Extension Points

### Adding a New Platform

1. Create `platform/newplatform/` directory
2. Implement `platform.h` with the `Platform<...>` template
   exposing a `capabilities` type and a `hal` type
3. Implement HAL functions matching the interface the engine
   expects (sprite positioning, sound register writes,
   interrupt installation, etc.)
4. The engine compiles against it with zero modifications

### Adding a New Hardware Extension (e.g., new Atari add-on)

1. Add a new axis value (e.g., `atari::NewHardware::Present`)
2. Add capability entries to the capability profile
3. Add HAL functions for the new hardware
4. Engine subsystems that can benefit add `if constexpr`
   branches — existing code paths are unaffected

### Adding a New Engine Subsystem

1. Create `engine/newsubsystem.h`
2. Template on `Platform` type
3. Query capabilities, call HAL as needed
4. Register interrupt needs with the Interrupt Manager
5. Integrate into `Core` — add as a facet
6. Game code accesses via `Game::newsubsystem.method()`
